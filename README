CLASS STRUCTURE

Entity
    This is a skeleton for any object that appears on the screen. To add
    functionality, various Components are attached to an Entity. The
    EntityHandler is responsible for creating and destroying entities.

Handlers (aka. Systems)
    CollisionHandler, DrawingHandler, EntityHandler, InputHandler,
    LocationHandler, SoundHandler
    These objects handle entities, performing various functions depending on
    the entity's components. For example, the LocationHandler will look at
    each entity's current LocationComponent and PhysicsComponent to calculate
    where the entity should move to. Once these calculations are made, the
    Handler will update that Entity's LocationComponent and PhysicsComponent.
    Handlers can emit commands if they want another Handler to do something
    for them.

Components
    ArtComponent, InputComponent, LocationComponent, PhysicsComponent,
    StatsComponent
    These define certain types of behavior for an entity. They are purely data
    objects, and their fields are used to determine how handlers interact with
    them.

Commands
    These are used to by Handlers to communicate with each other. Each handler
    handles a different set of commands.

GameManager
    The game manager maintains the game loop, all entities, and all commands.
    It is also responsible for startup and shutdown of the game.
