Game Title: Undecided


Vision


A two-player, side-scrolling platformer. The screen will scroll forward at a set pace, and both players
must keep up with the screen while fighting each other. The players will have life bars which will deplete 
by hitting certain obstacles, being hit by the other player, or if they are being dragged along by the left
side of the screen and not keeping up. Throughout the level, players will have to jump over and across obstacles,
and will also use platforms strategically in combat to dodge and hit the other player. The game will always
be two-player and will end if one player's life bar depletes completely.


We decided to keep the two-player, set-scrolling mechanic despite doubts, but we'll keep in mind the challenges
it may cause us and make sure the game is fun.


Background Story


Finally, after a whole summer of doing nothing except having fun, two new JHU student arrives on campus 
anticipating an exciting year ahead. However, as life never happens the way you want it to, these student
will face various obstacles that threatens the possibility of successful graduation. Due to the limited 
resources at JHU, these students fight each other, trying to reach the destination before their opponent.
The game will be PG in the sense that there will be no blood or gore, and students will never face serious 
injury - rather, they will simply appear dazed and clearly unable to continue running when their life bars run out. 


Example level goals:
- getting the last enrollment spot by reaching the university registrar.
- getting to first day of class without being late
- fight for the last library spot in Brody
- fight for the last spring fair concert ticket


Game Setting


Running through a campus setting with benches, trees, and buildings (static) while trying to avoid moving
freshmen and tourist groups (dynamic). In each stage, the characters are trying to keep up with the
screen while knocking their opponents back to prevent them from reaching the destination, and also
navigating the obstacles with jumping, wall slides, etc. Note that although we will be trying our best
to mimic the JHU campus, the story is set at an unknown campus so that we maximize the target audience to
all college students, yet JHU students might recognize some unique elements that let them realize it's
the JHU campus. This will reduce the amount of graphic overload from attempt to mimic JHU exactly as it is.


For example, the students can be going from dorm to Garland Hall to get to the university registrar 
for the last spot in Peter's class (thus, forcing the students to fight each other and get to there 
as fast as possible before the last spot is taken).


Music/sound effect:
Campus music that varies based on the levels. Ex: Hippy music, orchestra music, terrible pop music, etc.


Art style: Pixel art


Rough Levels
As level progresses, more obstacles will show up and more power ups will be given to the players. 


Example Levels:
- Level one, getting the last enrollment spot by reaching the university registrar.
Obstacles: static obstacles such as trees, pits, etc.
- Level two, getting to first day of class without being late. 
Obstacles: previous static obstacles, friends that stops you to say hello, etc.
- Level three, fight for the last library spot in Brody. 
Obstacles: previous obstacles, angry fellow students, dancers, alcoholic frats, pot pit, etc.




IMPORTANT: We decided to remove procedural generation from our goals due to suggestions to scale back our goals.


Game Mechanics
* Basic mechanics: left, right, up/jump, and down/duck while the stage moves constantly to the right
* Control Scheme: Keyboard (wasd + shift for player 1 and arrow keys + space for player 2)
* Performance evaluated based on level survival
* The game will focus on dexterity (avoiding obstacles and enemies) and combat (trying to kill another player with projectiles that drop off with range).
* Most levels will stick to the general student & university scene, but maybe a few special ones about instructors or student party scenes.
* Character will have HP bars that sustains a certain number of hits
* The stage constantly moves to the right, and the characters must stay within frame to avoid losing health
* The levels are cleared and unlocked one at a time, but you can choose specific levels that you've previously unlocked from the menu
* Powerups
   * Coffee/Espresso Shot (speeds up the character)
   * Textbooks (lets you pretend to be reading and avoid friends)
   * FFC meals (fill HP up)
   * Pizza (makes you bigger and more susceptible to obstacles and attacks)
   * Alcohol (inverts the control directions of other player)


CORE MECHANIC:
combat - both players should be able strategically/skillfully try to avoid each other and hit each other.
maneuver - both players need to skillfully avoid obstacles or bad powerups.


* Physics
   * Wall Jumps
   * Mario physics (does not have to be realistic, but still fun)
* Unlockable characters, missions, and items
   * New faculty
   * Free t-shirts
* No bosses


Plan
Milestone plans


Alpha (2 weeks)
* Two characters with a static level. (Grady and Pratyush)
* With various static obstacles that do not move (such as expired chipotle meal laying around).  (Grady and Pratyush)
* Need to start the physics of the game (Andrew and Akshay)
   * Gravity (maybe not real acceleration)
   * Running speed
   * Projectile (maybe without drop for now)
   * Simple damage
* Rudimentary sounds (All members)


Beta (3 weeks)
* Finish the choice of background music and sound design  (All members)
* Complete important character graphics (Grady and Pratyush)
* Move through the stages (All Members)
* More powerups and obstacles (All Members)
* Finish most of the background item graphics, such as trees, benches, etc. (Grady and Pratyush)
* Need to almost complete the realistic physics of the game. (Andrew and Akshay)
   * Mario physics acceleration for players and projectiles
   * Wall jumping




Gold (2 weeks)
* Polish everything to make it ready for demo (All members)
* Balancing for powerups (All members)
* New characters/levels depending on how much makes it to beta (All members)


Member responsibilities
* Akshay
   * Coding
   * Sound and music
* Andrew
   * Coding
   * Realistic physics
* Grady
   * Coding
   * Graphics
* Pratyush Trivedi
   * Coding
   * Graphics


Major risks
* Gameplay that feels too random due to level
   * Solution: Add more skill components to the game
* We could fall behind on the graphics
   * Solution: Grab graphics off internet if needed. Work hard to keep up.
* Messy codes
   * Solution: Write better code and peer code reviews


Technical Details
* Programming language: C++
* Communication method: Facebook Messenger
* Cross-platform compatibility:
   * Will make sure the game runs on Ubuntu
   * So far, it also supports mac
* Mobile Version: No
* Meeting Time: Wednesday lab and Saturdays
* Submission:
   * Grady will be responsible for submissions, but a reminder will be sent out by the group
     members to avoid late penalties.
* Git:
   * Divide the development process into three branches: Master, Develop, and Feature
   * Master branch are the major stages of the game: alpha, beta, and gold
   * Develop contains the stable version of the features added to the game
   * Feature branch contains the ongoing development of new features




Improvements/suggestions after listening to class presentations:
* Add a tutorial level
* Different stats in the end so people can view their own stat
* Maybe no networking and procedurally generated stages.


Updates to Last Version:
* The game will still be multiplayer, but the game will end immediately after 2nd player dies
* The game will not involve any killing of students. There will be no blood effects.
* To reduce the graphics, we will change JHU theme to the general college theme. This way, we do not 
need the specific JHU benches, colors, etc. However, we will try to mimic the graphics toward JHU if 
possible so that JHU students can recognize the setting as JHU. This change also creates a larger target
audience from just JHU students to all college students.
* We will implement the tile-block level editor instead of the procedurally generated stages.
* The game will no longer support network game play.
* The game will stick with the automatic scrolling or "move by itself" platform. This way, the game mimics a time-pressured, multiplayer Mario Bros
* We will implement the entity-component design for this game
* The game will have Mario physics instead of real-word physics
