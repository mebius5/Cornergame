\\\\\\\\\
Background Story
\\\\\\\\\
Finally, after a whole summer of doing nothing except having fun, two new JHU student arrives on campus anticipating an exciting year ahead. However, as life never happens the way you want it to, these student will face various obstacles that threatens the possibility of successful graduation. Due to the limited resources at JHU, these students must fight each other to survive.

Example level goals:
- getting the last enrollment spot by reaching the university registrar.
- getting to first day of class without being late
- fight for the last library spot in Brody
- fight for the last spring fair concert ticket

\\\\\\\\\
Game Setting
\\\\\\\\\
Running through JHU campus with benches, trees, and buildings (static) while trying to avoid moving freshmen and tourist groups (dynamic). In each stage, the characters are trying to move to the right as fast as possible to reach the destination while trying to kill each other, and also navigating the obstacles with jumping, wall slides, etc.

For example, the students can be going from dorm to Garland Hall to get to the university registrar for the last spot in Peter's class (thus, forcing the students to fight each other and get to there as fast as possible before the last spot is taken).

Music/sound effect: Campus backgroundMusic that varies based on the levels. Ex: Hippy backgroundMusic, orchestra backgroundMusic, terrible pop backgroundMusic, etc.

Art style: Pixel art

\\\\\\\\\
Rough Levels
\\\\\\\\\
As level progresses, more obstacles will show up and more power ups will be given to the players. 

Example Levels:
- Level one, getting the last enrollment spot by reaching the university registrar. Obstacles: static obstacles such as trees, pits, etc.
- Level two, getting to first day of class without being late. Obstacles: previous static obstacles, friends that stops you to say hello, etc.
- Level three, fight for the last library spot in Brody. Obstacles: previous obstacles, angry fellow students, dancers, alcoholic frats, pot pit, etc.

The specific design of the levels will be procedurally generated to keep players on their toes, but will be composed of the elements mentioned above.

\\\\\\\\\
Game Mechanics
\\\\\\\\\
Basic mechanics: left, right, up/jump, and down/duck while the stage moves constantly to the right
Control Scheme: Keyboard (wasd for player 1 and arrow keys for player 2)
Performance evaluated based on level survival
The game will focus on dexterity (avoiding obstacles and enemies) and combat (trying to kill another player with projectiles that drop off with range).
Most levels will stick to the general student & university scene, but maybe a few special ones about instructors or student party scenes.
Character will have HP bars that sustains a certain number of hits
Static background at first, but as development progresses, change into procedurally generated world.
The stage constantly moves to the right, and the characters must stay within frame to survive
The levels are cleared and unlocked one at a time, but you can choose specific levels that you've previously unlocked from the menu

Powerups
- Coffee/Espresso Shot (speeds up the character)
- Textbooks (lets you pretend to be reading and avoid friends)
- FFC meals (fill HP up)
- Pizza (makes you bigger and more susceptible to obstacles and attacks)
- Alcohol (inverts the control directions)

Realistic Physics (similar to N game)
- Wall Jumps
- Acceleration of running speed
- Gravitational acceleration for players and projectiles

The game features unlockable characters, missions, and items
- New faculty
- Free t-shirts

The game will not have any bosses since the players are trying to kill each other to survive


Plan
\\\\\\\\\
Milestone plans
\\\\\\\\\
Alpha (2 weeks)
- Two characters with a static level (not procedurally generated). (Grady and Pratyush)
- With various static obstacles that do not move (such as expired chipotle meal laying around).  (Grady and Pratyush)
- Need to start the physics of the game (Andrew and Akshay)
- Gravity (maybe not real acceleration)
- Running speed
- Projectile (maybe without drop for now)
- Simple damage
- Rudimentary sounds (All members)

Beta (3 weeks)
- Finish the choice of background backgroundMusic and sound design  (All members)
- Complete important character graphics (Grady and Pratyush)
- Ability to move through the stages (All Members)
- More powerups and obstacles (All Members)
- Finish most of the background item graphics, such as trees, benches, etc. (Grady and Pratyush)
- Need to almost complete the realistic physics of the game. (Andrew and Akshay)
- Realistic gravitational acceleration for players and projectiles
- Wall jumping
- Need to be have ability to have procedurally generated levels or stages. (Andrew and Akshay)

Gold (2 weeks)
- Polish everything to make it ready for demo (All members)
- Balancing for powerups (All members)
- New characters/levels depending on how much makes it to beta (All members)

\\\\\\\\\
Major risks
\\\\\\\\\
- Procedural generation can break the game
Solution: Lots of testing and ask Peter
- Gameplay that feels too random due to level
Solution: Add more skill components to the game
- We could fall behind on the graphics
Solution: Grab graphics off internet if needed. Work hard to keep up.
- Messy codes
Solution: Write better code and peer code reviews

\\\\\\\\\
Technical Details
\\\\\\\\\
- Programming language: C++ (80% possibility) / Go (20% possibility)
- Communication method: Facebook Messenger
- Cross-platform compatibility:
Will make sure the game runs on Ubuntu
- Mobile Version: No
- Meeting Time: Wednesday lab and Saturday
- Submission:
We will determine the person responsible for submission at each meeting
- Git:
Divide the development process into three branches: Master, Develop, and Feature
Master branch are the major stages of the game: alpha, beta, and gold
Develop contains the stable version of the features added to the game
Feature branch contains the ongoing development of new features
